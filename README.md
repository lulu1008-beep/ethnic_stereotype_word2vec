# word2vec

questions 08/23/21:
1) errors in the script?
2) looks like I can only get the word vector in my_corpus. If the word is not present in my_corpus, then I can't get its vector. Is this normal? (I think my own model should contain the vectors/vocabulary from the pretrained model and my own model.) 
3) are there only 1323 words in my own model? (Something goes wrong?)
